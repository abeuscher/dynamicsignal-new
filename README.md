## Dynamic Signal
# v 2.1.0

This is a Wordpress theme developed for dynamicsignal.com. It does not leverage any interior features of Wordpress, and as such does not instantiate wp_head or wp_footer.

This theme was reworked in the Winter of 2017/2018 to reflect new corporate branding and a new site layout.

To install, this folder should be set in the root of the backup folder from flywheel (http://getflywheel.com).

After installing, pull up a bash terminal and run

  npm install

(if npm is not yet installed please seek instructions at https://www.npmjs.com/)

Then run

  gulp

(if gulp is not installed please find instructions at https://gulpjs.com/)

This should build the theme folder (labelled "ds-new") into the wordpress theme folder.

This app uses PUG (https://pugjs.org/) as its templating language.
