## Dynamic Signal
# v 5.2.1

This is a Wordpress theme developed for dynamicsignal.com

To install, this folder should be set in the root of the backup folder from flywheel (http://getflywheel.com).

After installing, pull up a bash terminal and run

  npm install

(if npm is not yet installed please seek instructions at https://www.npmjs.com/)

Then run

  gulp

(if gulp is not installed please find instructions at https://gulpjs.com/)

This should build two theme folders (labelled "ds-new" and "ds-uk") into the wordpress theme folder.

Paths can be altered in settings.js at the root of the project.

This app uses PUG (https://pugjs.org/) as its templating language.
